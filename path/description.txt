The path folder contains files or data structures that store the file paths or directory locations of videos, images, or extracted features used in the project. These paths are typically referenced during data loading, preprocessing, or feature extraction steps. The contents of this folder help the program locate and access the required data efficiently without hardcoding paths directly into the code.
